# Real-Time Data Verification Checklist

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Currency Fix Applied

**All data now uses exact Plaid currency (USD for sandbox, not INR)**

If you have existing data with INR currency, you need to:
1. Clear old data: `db.accounts.deleteMany({})` and `db.transactions.deleteMany({})`
2. Reconnect your bank account via Plaid Link
3. All amounts will now show with $ symbol matching Plaid exactly

## Status Check Commands

### Check if servers are running:
```powershell
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like "*node*"}
```

### Check MongoDB connection:
```powershell

use financial-agent
db.accounts.count()
db.transactions.count()
```

### Test API endpoints:
```powershell
