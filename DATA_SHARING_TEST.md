# Data Sharing Feature - Test Guide

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Problem
The AI was giving personalized answers even when data sharing was OFF.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Backend Logic Enhanced** - Properly checks data sharing state before generating responses
2. **Logging Added** - Console logs show which mode is active
3. **AI Prompts Improved** - Clear instructions for personalized vs generic responses
4. **Visual Indicators** - Badge shows "Personalized" or "Generic" on each AI message

## üß™ How to Test

### Test 1: Generic Mode (Data Sharing OFF)

**Steps:**
1. Open AI Chat page
2. Click the lock icon in header to **DISABLE** data sharing
3. Verify indicator shows "Generic" (gray)
4. Ask: **"What is my total spending this month?"**

**Expected Result:**
```
AI Response should:
‚úÖ NOT mention specific dollar amounts from your accounts
‚úÖ Provide general advice about tracking spending
‚úÖ Use phrases like "typically", "generally", "most people"
‚úÖ End with: "üí° Want Personalized Advice? Enable data sharing..."
‚úÖ Show "Generic" badge on the message
```

**Example Generic Response:**
```
To track your monthly spending, you should:

1. Review all transactions from the past 30 days
2. Categorize expenses (housing, food, transportation, etc.)
3. Compare total expenses to your income

Generally, financial experts recommend keeping expenses below 80% 
of your income to maintain a healthy savings rate.

üí° Want Personalized Advice? Enable data sharing in the chat header 
to get specific recommendations based on your actual financial data!
```

### Test 2: Personalized Mode (Data Sharing ON)

**Steps:**
1. Click the unlock icon to **ENABLE** data sharing
2. Verify indicator shows "Personalized" (green)
3. Ask the SAME question: **"What is my total spending this month?"**

**Expected Result:**
```
AI Response should:
‚úÖ Include ACTUAL dollar amounts from your transactions
‚úÖ Reference specific categories with real numbers
‚úÖ Calculate percentages based on YOUR data
‚úÖ Provide specific recommendations for YOUR situation
‚úÖ Show "Personalized" badge on the message
```

**Example Personalized Response:**
```
Based on your financial data, you've spent $2,450.75 this month 
across all categories. Here's the breakdown:

üí∞ Top Spending Categories:
‚Ä¢ Food and Dining: $850.00 (35%)
‚Ä¢ Transportation: $420.50 (17%)
‚Ä¢ Shopping: $380.25 (16%)
‚Ä¢ Bills & Utilities: $320.00 (13%)
‚Ä¢ Entertainment: $180.00 (7%)

üìä Analysis:
This represents a 12% increase from last month ($2,188.50). 
Your dining expenses are notably high.

üéØ Recommendations:
1. Set a monthly dining budget of $600 (saving $250/month)
2. Use meal planning to reduce restaurant visits
3. Track daily spending to stay aware

With your current income of $5,200/month, you're spending 47% 
on these categories, leaving a healthy 53% for savings and other goals.
```

### Test 3: Toggle During Conversation

**Steps:**
1. Start with data sharing ON
2. Ask: **"How much did I spend on food?"**
3. Get personalized response with actual numbers
4. Toggle data sharing OFF
5. Ask: **"How can I reduce my food spending?"**
6. Get generic response without specific numbers

**Expected Result:**
```
‚úÖ First response: Specific amounts (e.g., "$850 on food")
‚úÖ Second response: General tips (no specific amounts)
‚úÖ Each message shows correct badge (Personalized/Generic)
‚úÖ Backend logs show mode switching
