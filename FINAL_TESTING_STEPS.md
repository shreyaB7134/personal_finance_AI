## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: AI Says "I don't have access to your financial data"
**Solution:** This is correct behavior BEFORE linking bank account
- Link your bank account via Plaid first
- Wait for transactions to sync
- Then try AI assistant again

### Issue: No Transactions Showing
**Possible Causes:**
1. Bank account not linked yet
2. Plaid sync failed
3. MongoDB not storing data

**Solutions:**
1. Link bank account via Plaid
2. Check server logs for errors
3. Manually trigger sync: `POST /api/plaid/sync-transactions`
4. Check MongoDB collections:
   ```javascript
   db.accounts.find()
   db.transactions.find()
   ```

### Issue: Plaid Link Not Opening
**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `PLAID_CLIENT_ID` and `PLAID_SECRET` in server/.env
3. Ensure backend is running
4. Check CORS configuration

### Issue: AI Gives Generic Responses
**Solutions:**
1. Ensure bank account is linked
2. Verify transactions are synced
3. Check that `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correct
4. Check server logs for Gemini API errors

## üìä Verification Checklist

### Backend API Endpoints
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Get accounts (after linking)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/accounts -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Get transactions (after linking)
curl http://localhost:5000/api/transactions -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Test AI assistant (after linking)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/assistant/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"how much is my bank balance currently"}'
```

### Database Verification
```javascript
// In MongoDB Atlas or Compass
use financial-agent

// Check users
db.users.find()

// Check accounts (should have data after Plaid link)
db.accounts.find()

// Check transactions (should have data after Plaid link)
db.transactions.find().limit(10)
```
