## 🎯 Tips for Best Results

### ✅ DO:
- **Be specific** - "How much did I spend on restaurants?" vs "spending?"
- **Ask follow-ups** - The AI remembers your conversation
- **Enable data sharing** - For personalized, accurate advice
- **Link your bank** - More data = better insights

### ❌ DON'T:
- Ask about other people's finances (AI only knows YOUR data)
- Expect investment guarantees (AI provides guidance, not guarantees)
- Share sensitive info like passwords or PINs
- Rely solely on AI for major financial decisions (consult professionals)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Your Data is Safe
- ✅ All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- ✅ Gemini API doesn't store your conversations
- ✅ You control data sharing with one click
- ✅ Chat history stored securely in your account
- ✅ Only YOU can see your chats

### What the AI Knows (When Data Sharing is ON)
- Account balances and types
- Transaction history (last 30 days)
- Income and expense patterns
- Spending categories
- Currency and account details

### What the AI NEVER Knows
- Your passwords or PINs
- Your Plaid credentials
- Your bank login details
- Your social security number
- Any data you don't explicitly share

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### AI Not Responding
**Problem**: Message sent but no response
**Solution**: 
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Gemini API key is configured
3. Refresh the page
4. Check browser console for errors

### Getting Generic Responses Only
**Problem**: AI not using my financial data
**Solution**:
1. Check data sharing is enabled (green indicator)
2. Verify Plaid account is connected
3. Ensure you have transactions in last 30 days

### Slow Responses
**Problem**: AI takes 5+ seconds to respond
**Solution**: This is normal! Gemini API typically takes 2-4 seconds. Complex questions may take longer.

### Chat History Not Saving
**Problem**: Messages disappear after refresh

1. Check you're logged in
