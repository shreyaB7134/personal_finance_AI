## Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. AI Service (`server/src/services/aiService.ts`)
```typescript
- getFinancialContext(): Fetches comprehensive user financial data
- buildContextString(): Formats data for AI consumption
- generatePersonalizedResponse(): Creates context-aware responses
- generateGenericResponse(): Provides general advice without data
- generateSuggestedQuestions(): Dynamic question suggestions
```

#### 2. Chat Model (`server/src/models/Chat.ts`)
```typescript
interface IChat {
  userId: ObjectId
  messages: IMessage[]
  dataSharing: boolean
  timestamps: true
}

interface IMessage {
  role: 'user' | 'assistant'
  content: string
  timestamp: Date
}
```

#### 3. Chat Routes (`server/src/routes/chat.ts`)
```
GET    /api/chat/session          - Get or create chat session
POST   /api/chat/message          - Send message and get AI response
GET    /api/chat/history          - Get conversation history
DELETE /api/chat/clear            - Clear chat history
GET    /api/chat/suggestions      - Get suggested questions
PUT    /api/chat/data-sharing     - Update data sharing preference
```

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Chat Page (`client/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`)
- Full-screen chat interface
- Message bubbles (user vs assistant)
- Data sharing toggle in header
- Suggested questions for new users
- Auto-scroll to latest message
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to send)

#### 2. Navigation Integration
- Added to bottom navigation bar
- Sparkles icon for AI Chat
- Accessible from all main pages

## Usage Examples

### Example Queries (Personalized Mode)

**User:** "What is my total spending this month?"
**AI Response:** Based on your financial data, you've spent $2,450.75 this month across all categories. Your top spending categories are:
- Food and Dining: $850.00
- Transportation: $420.50
- Shopping: $380.25

This represents a 12% increase from last month. Consider reviewing your dining expenses to improve your savings rate.

**User:** "Can I afford to buy a house?"
**AI Response:** Based on your current financial situation:
- Total Balance: $44,930.00
- Monthly Income: $5,200.00
- Monthly Expenses: $2,450.75
- Savings Rate: 52.9%

You're saving approximately $2,749.25 per month, which is excellent! For a house purchase, consider:
1. Down Payment: With your current balance, you could afford a 10% down payment on a $449,300 home
2. Monthly Mortgage: Keep it under $1,560 (30% of income)
3. Emergency Fund: Maintain 6 months expenses ($14,704.50)

I recommend continuing to save for 6-12 more months to build a larger down payment and reduce PMI costs.

### Example Queries (Generic Mode)

**User:** "What is my total spending this month?"
**AI Response:** I can help you understand spending patterns! To track your monthly spending:
1. Review all transactions from the past 30 days
2. Categorize expenses (housing, food, transport, etc.)
3. Compare to your income to calculate savings rate

üí° Tip: Enable data sharing in your profile to get personalized advice based on your actual financial data!
