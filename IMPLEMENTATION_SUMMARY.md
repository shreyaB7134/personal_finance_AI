### Data Sharing Logic Flow
```
User sends message
    ↓
Frontend sends: { message, chatId, dataSharing }
    ↓
Backend checks: chat.dataSharing
    ↓
If TRUE:                          If FALSE:
  → Fetch financial context         → Skip data fetching
  → Build context string             → Use generic prompt
  → Enhanced personalized prompt     → Generic education prompt
  → Call Gemini API                  → Call Gemini API
  → Return with real data            → Return general advice
    ↓                                  ↓

## 📊 Example Comparisons

### Question: "What is my total spending this month?"

**Generic Mode (Data Sharing OFF):**
```
To track your monthly spending, you should review all 
transactions from the past 30 days and categorize them 
into groups like housing, food, transportation, etc.

Generally, financial experts recommend:
• Keeping expenses below 80% of income
• Tracking spending daily or weekly
• Using budgeting apps or spreadsheets

💡 Want Personalized Advice? Enable data sharing in the 
chat header to get specific recommendations based on your 
actual financial data!
```

**Personalized Mode (Data Sharing ON):**
```
Based on your financial data, you've spent $2,450.75 this 
month across all categories.

💰 Top Spending Categories:
• Food and Dining: $850.00 (35%)
• Transportation: $420.50 (17%)
• Shopping: $380.25 (16%)

📊 Analysis:
This represents a 12% increase from last month. Your dining 
expenses are notably high compared to the recommended 15-20%.

🎯 Recommendations:
1. Set a monthly dining budget of $600 (save $250/month)
2. Meal prep on weekends to reduce restaurant visits
3. Use a spending tracker app for daily awareness

With your income of $5,200/month, you're spending 47% on 
these categories, which is healthy. Keep up the good work!
